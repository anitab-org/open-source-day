    - title: Sure, It's Open, But Is It Inclusive?
      description: This workshop invites you to explore how you can create more inclusive open source code, docs and communities, with a focus on language. Many open source projects are still filled with exclusionary language that can have a negative impact on people even while not being used with exclusionary intent. We'll look at some such examples of technical and nontechnical terms with problematic origins and connotations, discuss more inclusive alternatives, and then practise addressing "inclusion debt" in projects. You'll also learn that like tech debt, inclusion debt is also never done because language use is always shifting. Your projects will need multiple perspectives to shift and grow with it!

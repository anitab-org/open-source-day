As part of the Contribution Track, you will contribute code to our partner open source software (OSS) projects. You will work in groups, where you’ll have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from experienced mentors, there to guide and help you make your OSS contribution. 

Additionally, we have a "Choose your own adventure" option, where you have the opportunity to contribute code to projects led by women maintainers or to just any project in the OSS community.

**New to Open Source? Don’t worry! You will not be alone;** We will guide you through finding issues that are suited for your skill level and there will be mentors ready to help you.

These quality criteria include good performance, exceptional security, resilience and endurance, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites.  In addition to verifying that functionally complete runtimes are release ready, the AQA tests may also serve to verify new functionality during runtime development. | [Shelley Lambert](https://github.com/smlambert), [Lan Xia](https://github.com/llxia), and [Sophia Guo](https://github.com/sophia-guo) |

Participants will learn how to use the Tasking Manager and OSM editing tools. The Project Task will be decided based on urgent disaster or data needs at the time of the event. This could include mapping to assist emergency organizations responding to hurricanes, floods, epidemics, etc. No coding or mapping experience is necessary. Participants are encouraged to navigate to openstreetmap.org and set up an OSM account prior to the event. Github will not be used for this project. | [Maggie Cawley](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/MaggieMaps) and [Jess Beutler](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/jessbeutler) |

Additionally, there are multiple sub-projects with expanding software. The openSUSE project supports the hardware architectures x86, arm, PowerPC and the mainframe architecture s390x (IBM Z). Participants in this Open Source Day project will learn about multiple ways of openSUSE contributions and how to become an openSUSE Member. In addition, they receive an insight how to enable application software as Container Images or packages. Do you want to help make a contribution? Then go to an openSUSE Mentor and you will be allowed to receive your first openSUSE experience on a mainframe with the name LinuxONE (outside of your pc hardware experience). We support you during your first steps with contributions to Linux.

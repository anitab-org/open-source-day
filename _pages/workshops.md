Open Source Day hands-on workshops are dedicated to help you overcome barriers to contributing to open source. 

You will have a chance to attend technical and non-technical workshops and walk away with skills you can leverage in open source contributions.


## Build production ready data engineering pipeline using Open Source Framework (Kedro)

Bye-bye Jupyter Notebook! Are you working on a Machine Learning project? Do you have all data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training code in a Jupyter notebook? If the answer is yes, come join us to learn how you can easily upgrade your code to be production ready! In this workshop, we will introduce an open-source Python framework called Kedro, which is designed for building reliable data pipeline and maintainable data science code. We will cover what Kedro can and cannot do; what are the 4 core concepts in Kedro framework; then we will build our first Kedro based data pipeline together!

## Don’t Sacrifice Security When Coding Your Next Game-Changing App!

Open Source Software (OSS) is hot! But with stories of exploits and stolen data, it can be scary! Creating secure software means you must make your own code safe, but also know any security issues in OSS libraries. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to find vulnerabilities in the OSS you are using, no matter the language or tech. As a result, you will become fearless coding with OSS!

## Hack an Open-Source Database Together

Databases are crucial to modern applications today, and they come in many flavors. Even though they are widely used, like other system software they are often viewed as black boxes. In this workshop, we will take a peek under the covers of a mission-critical enterprise-grade open-source database system and implement a small feature together using test-drive development (TDD), GitHub, and raise a pull request.

## How to Write an Accessible Pull Request

Web accessibility is the practice of making a product or feature usable for as many people as possible. This practice ensures that users with disabilities can perceive, navigate, understand, and interact with websites, tools, and technologies. Web accessibility fosters inclusion and diversity by removing barriers that make it impossible for some people to use the web.

Diversity is an important part of tech because it helps create a culture that welcomes new ideas and brings more perspectives together to solve problems. Projects tend to perform better with a diverse set of participants. With that being said open source are still facing issues maintaining a diverse set of contributors. A recent study on The [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Source](https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/the-2021-linux-foundation-report-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-open-source/), conducted by the Linux Foundation, showed that 18% of respondents do not feel welcome in open source. A large number of the respondents that did not feel welcome came from disproportionately underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities.

This workshop will demonstrate how we as developers can remove barriers and create a more inclusive open source community by adding accessibility into the markdown in a pull request.

Markdown is a formatting language that generates semantic html from plaintext and it is used in pull request to write descriptions and create comments. Writing proper semantic html is critical for accessible users. Because the semantic html generated from markdown reinforces the meaning of information and can be easily read by assistive technologies.

## Overcoming the Fear of Contributing to Open

If you’re feeling uncertain about contributing to an open source project for the first time, Rizel can relate. Navigating the open source space can feel intimidating. Mentors and managers always advised Rizel to contribute to open source, but it was difficult. She would feel anxious and overwhelmed by the large codebases and the confusing issues. In August 2021, she took a different approach. Instead of spiraling, she started small, read documentation, and interacted with the community. In this talk, Rizel will share funny anecdotes about her failed and successful attempts to contribute to open source. The audience will gain inspiration and confidence to make their first contribution.

## Shift Left with Quality: Scalable Testing Infrastructure in UI Automation

Many test automation practices rely on third party, out of the box frameworks as opposed to building out a native test framework. However, test automation written in this way can have a low return on investment. This typically causes client automation to run as an afterthought, acting as a simple report card of the product. Within our UI test automation spectrum, we’ve found a solution to help deconstruct what is truly important in the app and adopted a strategy that has encouraged collaboration between quality, engineering and product teams. A behavior-driven approach to UI test automation can increase your return on investment and confidence, all the while running in your CI/CD pipeline. To ensure smooth adoption, we developed a set of tools that can help your organization drive adoption of behavior driven development (BDD) within UI test automation using the Gherkin language.

## The Open Source Game

Open source ecosystems contain multitudes of people who are critical to the creation, maintenance, distribution, security, and usage of open source software. But depending on whom you talk to, each group will have a different perspective of what makes open source communities tick - sometimes they even talk to each other. And if you're new to open source, this presents a number of confusing obstacles to participation. 

This workshop will help participants see how "the falafel gets made" from the perspective of different open source ecosystem stakeholders. The premise is simple: You have all been called to the White House to discuss a new security issue with the open source supply chain, and the department of Homeland Security is desperate to understand how to address it. Some of you will represent a non-profit software foundation that oversees the governance of a number of affected software communities. Or a lone developer just trying to keep up with the demand. Or in-house legal counsel at a company that uses this software. Or a risk manager from a financial institution. Or the CEO of a startup building products on the affected software. Or the CISO of a cloud vendor that both maintains and uses the software in question. 

From these various perspectives, you will learn about the complexity involved in maintaining the robust innovation that defines open source communities and their respective ecosystems. Is open source the engine of software innovation? Is it a way for startups to market themselves? Is it a grave risk to the daily operations of critical services? And how can we pull together all of these perspectives to achieve our goal of well-functioning software ecosystems?

Workshop attendees will participate in this mock open source problem resolution and develop a more nuanced understanding of the level of effort required to sustain open source software communities.

## When Design Thinking Meets Open Source

When it comes to open source contributions – design is often a second thought. There is a plethora of innovative open source software that are made with little or no contribution from experienced designers, which often lead to inconsistent interfaces, confusing interactions and ultimately, a poor user experience. When paired together, strong open source projects and human-centered, empathetic design thinking can create software that users can actually use. This session will explore the opportunities for design in open source projects and how developers can exercise a few design practices to influence the adoption and usability of their project. It will examine what experience design is, why it matters, and the principles behind effective design. Attendees will learn through hands-on activities how to incorporate design thinking strategies into their projects without sacrificing design, and how doing so will result in a better product for their users.

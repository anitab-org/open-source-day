As part of the Learning Track, you can attend hands-on workshops to help you overcome the barriers to making open source contributions. You will have a chance to attend technical and non-technical workshops and walk away with skills you can leverage in open source contributions.


## Build production ready data engineering pipeline using Open Source Framework (Kedro)

Bye-bye Jupyter Notebook! Are you working on a Machine Learning project? Do you have all data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training code in a Jupyter notebook? If the answer is yes, come join us to learn how you can easily upgrade your code to be production ready! In this workshop, we will introduce an open-source Python framework called Kedro, which is designed for building reliable data pipeline and maintainable data science code. We will cover what Kedro can and cannot do; what are the 4 core concepts in Kedro framework; then we will build our first Kedro based data pipeline together!

## Don’t Sacrifice Security When Coding Your Next Game-Changing App!

Open Source Software (OSS) is hot! But with stories of exploits and stolen data, it can be scary! Creating secure software means you must make your own code safe, but also know any security issues in OSS libraries. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to find vulnerabilities in the OSS you are using, no matter the language or tech. As a result, you will become fearless coding with OSS!

## Hack an Open-Source Database Together

Databases are crucial to modern applications today, and they come in many flavors. Even though they are widely used, like other system software they are often viewed as black boxes. In this workshop, we will take a peek under the covers of a mission-critical enterprise-grade open-source database system and implement a small feature together using test-drive development (TDD), GitHub, and raise a pull request.

## How to Write an Accessible Pull Request

Web accessibility is the practice of making a product or feature usable for as many people as possible. It fosters inclusion and diversity by removing barriers that make it impossible for some people to use the web. Projects tend to perform better with a diverse set of participants. With that being said open source is still facing issues maintaining a diverse set of contributors. A recent study on The <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org/tools/the-2021-linux-foundation-report-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-open-source/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Source</a>, conducted by the Linux Foundation, showed that 18% of respondents do not feel welcome in open source. A large number of the respondents that did not feel welcome came from disproportionately underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities. This workshop will demonstrate how we as developers can remove barriers and create a more inclusive open source community by adding accessibility into the markdown in a pull request. Markdown is a formatting language that generates semantic html from plaintext and it is used in pull requests to write descriptions and create comments. Writing proper semantic html is critical for accessible users, as it can be easily read by assistive technologies.

## Shift Left with Quality: Scalable Testing Infrastructure in UI Automation

Many test automation practices rely on third party, out of the box frameworks as opposed to building out a native test framework. However, test automation written in this way can have a low return on investment. This typically causes client automation to run as an afterthought, acting as a simple report card of the product. Within our UI test automation spectrum, we’ve found a solution to help deconstruct what is truly important in the app and adopted a strategy that has encouraged collaboration between quality, engineering and product teams. A behavior-driven approach to UI test automation can increase your return on investment and confidence, all the while running in your CI/CD pipeline. To ensure smooth adoption, we developed a set of tools that can help your organization drive adoption of behavior driven development (BDD) within UI test automation using the Gherkin language.

## When Design Thinking Meets Open Source

When it comes to open source contributions – design is often a second thought. There is a plethora of innovative open source software that are made with little or no contribution from experienced designers, which often lead to inconsistent interfaces, confusing interactions and ultimately, a poor user experience. When paired together, strong open source projects and human-centered, empathetic design thinking can create software that users can actually use. This session will explore the opportunities for design in open source projects and how developers can exercise a few design practices to influence the adoption and usability of their project. It will examine what experience design is, why it matters, and the principles behind effective design. Attendees will learn through hands-on activities how to incorporate design thinking strategies into their projects without sacrificing design, and how doing so will result in a better product for their users.
